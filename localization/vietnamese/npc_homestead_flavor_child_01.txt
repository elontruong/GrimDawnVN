Mama said you might come back here.{^n}{^n}She needs to speak to you.
And where is your mama?
She said she had some important stuff to do by Malmouth. She said not to tell papa.{^n}{^n}I don't know what a Malmouth is, but it sounds gross.
I found that book and brought it back to your mama.
Good to know. Thanks.
I'll go talk to her then.
I'll go talk to her then.
Hello!{^n}{^n}Mama was talking about you. She said you like to stick your nose in books that aren't yours!
I found it and brought it back to your mama.
Oh! Well that was very nice of you.{^n}{^n}Mama writes in there all the time.
Take care, kid.

Take care, kid.
Well, it was a very important book.
Suỵt, đừng đánh thức em bé.
Cháu có gì thế?
Đây là Mona. Cháu có thể cho [[ms]chú[fs]cô] ôm nó, nhưng nó hư lắm nên sẽ khóc khi bất cứ ai ngoài cháu làm thế.
[[ms]Chú[fs]Cô] hiểu rồi. Cháu chăm sóc cho Mona nhé.
Được, [[ms]chú[fs]cô] sẽ giữ trật tự.
